# Simple PDF to Audiobook

This project converts PDF books into **AI-narrated audiobooks** using [Coqui-TTS](https://github.com/idiap/coqui-ai-TTS) (fork), PyMuPDF and jenkspy. Everything is done
locally so there is no need for api keys, credits, etc.

The workflow is very simple but it will improve in the future ‚Äî if you‚Äôre not afraid of tweaking a bit of code, you‚Äôll have no problem.

For now only PDFs are accepted but I may implement support for EPUB.

## üöÄ How to use it

1. **Extract text from the PDF**
   ```bash
   python extract_text.py
   ```

- The script opens `book.pdf` (the PDF must have this name).
- It generates a file `vision_output.json` containing the text blocks and their font sizes.
1. **Classify text blocks**
    
    ```bash
    python classify.py
    ```
    
    - Uses **Jenks natural breaks** to classify text as:
        - `header` (titles),
        - `body` (main content),
        - `caption` (subtitles),
        - `other` (things to skip, e.g. page numbers).
    - Saves the result as `classified_text.json`.
2. **Generate audio with Coqui-TTS**
    
    ```bash
    python tts.py
    ```
    
    - Converts each block from `classified_text.json` into audio.
    - Produces **one WAV file per block** inside the `temp/` folder.
    
    üëâ If you stop synthesis halfway through, it‚Äôs fine:
    
    all previously generated blocks remain in `temp/`, and you can continue from there.
    
3. **Join the audio files**
    
    ```bash
    python join_audios.py
    
    ```
    
    - Concatenates all `.wav` files from `temp/` into a single final `audiobook.mp3` using **FFmpeg**.

## üì¶ Dependencies

You‚Äôll need these libraries and tools installed:

- [**FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/) (make sure it‚Äôs in your PATH)
- [**Coqui-TTS (fork)**](https://coqui-tts.readthedocs.io/)
- [**PyMuPDF**](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/) (`pip install PyMuPDF`)
- [**jenkspy**](https://pypi.org/project/jenkspy/) (`pip install jenkspy`)
- [**Pydub**](https://pypi.org/project/pydub/)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- The input PDF must be named **`book.pdf`** and placed in the project folder.
- For now the pipeline is very **basic and experimental**. If you don‚Äôt mind tweaking some code, you can adjust things like:
    - The page ranges to process.
    - The thresholds for text classification.
    - The voice or language in Coqui-TTS.
- If the book is long, the audio is split into small blocks (`temp/block_X.wav`) so you don‚Äôt lose progress. You can edit the `tts.py` file to skip blocks you have already processed.
